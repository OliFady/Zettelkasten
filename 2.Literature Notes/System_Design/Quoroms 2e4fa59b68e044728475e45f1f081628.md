# Quoroms

Number of Nodes Ack to achieve Consistency

Quorom ≠ Majority 

### $Write Quorom + Read Quorom > No. of Nodes$

if No. of Write Quorom ≠ No. of Read Quorom ⇒ Flexible Quorom

Term ⇒ has specific Leader of Nooo Leader (Raft ensures there’s atleast one Leader)

### Node States

1-Follower ⇒starting point of all nodes, redirects all write requests to Leader / Reads only

2-Canditate ⇒ wants to be a Leader (sends RequestVote RPC Request)

3-Leader ⇒ Replicates Follower Nodes and waits till majority of Nodes respond (Heartbeats)
