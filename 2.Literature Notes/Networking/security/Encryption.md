# Encryption

## Symmetric Encryption

- Same Key is shared across all parties
- Target for a Man in the middle attack
- Aes, Triple DES are examples

## Asymmetric Encryption

- Text is raised to the power of the public key and modulated by the private key
- Public Key only Encrypts
- Private Key is known only by the sender 
- Expensive Operation (Movies can't be Asymmetrically Encrypted)
- RSA, DSA, Elgamal are examples
