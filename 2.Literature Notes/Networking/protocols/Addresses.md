## DNS

- *Hostnames* are Human-Readable (google.com), *Addresses* are not (192.168.1.1)
- One Hostname can map to multiple IP Addresses. Domain Name Server is responsible for routing each request.
## IP & Address Resolution Protocol

- Every PC has an ARP Table that looks for an IP Address inside it.
- If IP is not present, it sends an ARP Req to other Machines and stores that IP in ARP
- ECN Flag raises an Congestion Alert to TCP Layer
## DHCP

- Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol is found as a Server that gives IP Addresses.
